            <h2>Parcelia's Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>Having worked for almost three years as a library assistant in the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly (DUNS), Parcelia's primary duty is to support Political Secretaries and Honorable Members (ADUNS) in their research by supplying the data and reference materials they require. Accessing and arranging legal materials like Hansard, Gazette, Command Papers, Law Journals, and other literature is part of this.
            <br><br> Parcelia obtained useful experience as an administrative assistant at a construction company prior to taking on this position. Furthermore, not long after graduating from Politeknik Mukah, Sarawak, with a diploma in secretarial science, she volunteered at a Covid-19 Vaccination Center. Parcelia's varied past has probably given her a variety of abilities that she may use in her current role, such as customer service and administrative work.
            <br><br> In her capacity as a Library Assistant in a private, elite library, Parcelia is indispensable in meeting the informational and research demands of the Honorable Members and Political Secretaries. Her duties probably include getting and arranging reference materials, helping with literature searches, and giving briefings or summaries of pertinent data. In this specialized atmosphere, Parcelia's research abilities, attention to detail, and ability to operate discreetly and efficiently are probably highly respected.
            <br><br> Parcelia could make even more contributions to the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly if she keeps honing her skills in information management and legal and legislative research. Examining options for professional growth, including going to pertinent workshops or getting further certificates, could aid her in developing her knowledge and abilities in this area.</p>
